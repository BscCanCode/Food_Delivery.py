# Food Delivery App
A basic Python application to simulate a food ordering system, created by [Sid.py] on April 2025.

## Purpose
This Food Delivery App allows users to order, cancel, and manage food selections (Indian, Chinese, Italian), serving as a learning project to practice Python list operations, user input handling, and basic error management.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BscCanCode/food-delivery.git`  
   *(Replace with your actual repo URL if reusing, e.g., `todolist`.)*
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd food-delivery`
3. Run the script: `python food_delivery.py`  
   *(Rename `todolist.py` to `food_delivery.py` if using a new file.)*

## Features
- **Order Food**: Select and order from Indian, Chinese, or Italian cuisine (displayed immediately).
- **Cancel Order**: Cancel the last ordered food item (with empty check).
- **Exit**: Safely end the application.

## Usage Example
1. Run `python food_delivery.py`.
2. Choose `1` to order food.
3. Enter `1` to order Indian (e.g., "Indian" shown).
4. Choose `2` to cancel the order (e.g., "Nothing to cancel" if empty, or "Indian is cancelled").
5. Choose `3` to exit.

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (while loops, lists, `try-except` for error handling).
- Known Issue: Current code has a bug where `order.append(m)` fails due to type mismatch (string vs. list)â€”to be fixed.
- It do has issue,but i want to upload raw code,as this has developed a basic logic for such app

## NOTE
- This README is created with help from an AI chatbot.
- I know it has some erros,but it runs too,the reason i kept it as it is: because i want to show people what i understood and develop a code according to my understanding,as my logic and understanding will develop i may or may nor update the code.
